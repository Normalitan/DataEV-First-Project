EV Data Exploration Project
This explores a dataset of electric vehicles looking at various aspects of the data to gain insights.

The code loads and inspects the EV dataset retirieved on Kaggle. By Targeting brands in the dataset, it looks into their top speed, range, and efficiency.

Graphs displayed:
A bar graph to visualize the top 10 EV brands with maximum range.
Top 10 EV models with  maximum range displayed in a bar graph.
The 10 least efficient EV models displayed in bar graph with their prices.
Top 10 with Rapid Charge
Top 10 Brands Average Range with Rapid Charge

Towards the end is a work in progress graph where I try to combine my "Top 10 with Rapid Charge" pie chart and "Top 10 Brands Average Range w/ Rapid Charge" bar graph to get a nice uniformed look to see the data together, mainly to try to make it work at the moment.
